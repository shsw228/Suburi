# Suburi

Suburi is an app that aims to experiment with various interests in addition to SwiftUI.
Therefore, it contains almost no meaningful functionality. It just has a UI to perform certain functions.

The app consists of two screens:
- A ListView that displays the titles of the features.
- A DetailView for running the corresponding feature.
